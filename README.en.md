# ThinkFlow AI

[中文](./README.md) | English

**ThinkFlow AI** is a next-generation, local-first, AI-driven mind mapping tool built with Vue 3 and VueFlow. More than just a drawing app, it serves as a "brain augmentor" that thinks with you. By combining the divergent capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) with structured visualization, ThinkFlow AI rapidly transforms fuzzy ideas into clear, deep knowledge systems.

## 🌟 Why ThinkFlow AI?

Traditional mind mapping tools often require manual entry of every branch, which can become a bottleneck during a burst of inspiration. ThinkFlow AI redefines this process:

1.  **AI-Driven Automated Divergence**: Enter a core keyword, and the AI automatically expands outward based on logical chains, helping you break through "blank page anxiety."
2.  **Context-Aware Deep Dialogue**: Every node carries its full path context within the thinking tree. This means the AI understands _why_ you moved from A to B, generating more precise follow-up suggestions.
3.  **Multi-Dimensional Sensory Presentation**: Gain textual knowledge through deep "Answers," visual imagery through AI Image Generation, and macro insights through "Session Summaries."
4.  **Ultimate Privacy & Freedom**: Adopts a local-first architecture. Configurations are stored locally in your browser. Supports any OpenAI-compatible interface with no platform lock-in.

## 🚀 Core Functional Architecture

### 1. Intelligent Expansion System

- **Core Idea Activation**: Generate the foundation of your thinking tree with one click.
- **Path Contextual Follow-up**: Perform follow-ups on nodes; the AI reasons using the full logical path from the root to the current node.
- **Node Management**: Supports subtree collapsing for large-scale graphs to keep the workspace clean.

### 2. Deep Dive & Summarization

- **Deep Answer (Deep Dive)**: Generates 300-500 words of professional analysis for specific concepts, supporting rich Markdown formatting.
- **Visual Generation (Image Gen)**: Utilizes CogView or DALL-E to generate photorealistic visuals for nodes, reinforcing visual memory.
- **Global Summary**: Automatically analyzes the entire graph's logic to extract core insights and conclusions.

### 3. Canvas Interaction & Layout

- **Smart Tree Layout**: Built-in algorithm based on dynamic subtree height calculations to solve overlap issues after node expansion.
- **Linked Dragging**: When a parent node moves, child nodes move synchronously to maintain relative positions.
- **Versatile Export**: Perfectly supports exporting to structured Markdown, preserving all deep answer content.

## ⚙️ API Service Description (Important)

To provide an out-of-the-box experience, this project includes a default set of demo endpoints.

### 1. Demo Endpoint Details

- **Service Proxying**: Default requests are proxied and controlled via **Cloudflare Workers & Pages**.
- **Model Support**: Currently connected to Zhipu Bigmodel (glm-4-flash / cogview-3-flash) using free tiers.
- **Limitations**: As these are public demo endpoints, you may encounter rate limits or exhausted quotas.

### 2. Advanced Usage (Custom Endpoints)

For more stable and higher-quality generation (e.g., using GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.), we strongly recommend configuring your own API endpoints in **Settings**:

- **Base URL**: Your API proxy address (must support CORS).
- **Model**: Target model name.
- **API Key**: Your private key.

_Note: In custom mode, requests are sent directly from your browser to the target endpoint, bypassing any intermediaries for maximum security and efficiency._
